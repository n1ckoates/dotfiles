# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, managed with [`chezmoi`](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

## Installation

-   Run `sh -c "$(curl -fsLS git.io/chezmoi)" -- init --apply nchristopher` to clone this repository & apply the dotfiles with `chezmoi`. That's it!

Running the above command will also prompt you for your name & email, this is used in `~/.gitconfig`.
